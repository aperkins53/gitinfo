Git Notes
-git is a version control system used to track any file. Most notably used in development
-git commits are checksumed using SHA-1 meaning no corrupt files without knowing about it.

Three stages of git
1-modified
    -file changed, but it has not been committed (ex: normal work, or when saving)
2-staging
    -files that are marked to go into the next commit snapshot (utilizing git add script.js)
3-commit stage
    -data safely stored in the local databse (such as vm box, docker, computer, etc.)

To start tracking
1-git init
    -creates new project
    -your project should never be inside another project folder in order to avoid inverse tree tracking issues
2-git add <file> or git add . (all)
    -stages files for commit
3-git commit -m "message"
    -commits files so they are ready to push
4-git push upstream <branch_name>
    -pushes commit to github repository

Other git commands
    -git status - check on file staging
    -git log - tracks commits to branches
    -git branch <new_branch_name> - creates a new branch
    -git checkout -b <new_branch_name> - creates a new branch and switches to it
    -git checkout <branch_name> - switches to another branch
    -git branch -D <branch_name> - deletes branch
    -git reset <file_name> or git reset . (all) - removes an unstaged commit
    -git revert --hard <commit hash BEFORE the one you want removed> - removes an entire commit
    -git remote add upstream <repository link> - get link by creating a new repository on github and copy using clipboard button
